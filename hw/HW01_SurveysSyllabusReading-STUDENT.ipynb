    "I always try to use a model that is specifically trained for the task I want it to do, for instance, a python specialty model intead of a general chatbot for writing python code. This gets significantly better results than using a general tool, especially for math heavy questions. For coding prompts in general, if I have examples handy, I usually tell it to start there. If I am starting from scratch I tell the bot to give a list of libraries that do the thing I want along with example usages. Then I test out each one and tell it to expand the ones that work the best. If the bot gives suspicious answers on a particular topic (usually logical/mathematic processes), I do regular searches to verify what it's saying. When this happens I am likely to abandon the LLM as a tool entirely. It doesn't recover well when I run into those issues."
